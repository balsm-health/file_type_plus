# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-12

### Fixed
- `FileType.fromExtensionOrMime()` now truly prefers `extension` over `mimeType`
  when both are provided (previously the category order in `FileType.values`
  could make the MIME type win, e.g. extension `mp3` + MIME `image/jpeg`
  returned image instead of audio)
- `FileType(ExtensionGroupFilter)` no longer crashes with a null-check error
  when given a custom filter; the extension map is computed from the filter
- `FileType.fromPath()` no longer throws `FormatException` on unparseable
  input; it returns `FileType.other` as documented
- `FileType.fromPath()` now detects local file names containing `#` or `?`
  (e.g. `my#file.mp4`)
- Archive detection no longer misclassifies unrelated MIME types via loose
  substring matching (`application/marc`, `application/vnd.stardivision.*`,
  `application/vnd.ahead.space`, and others); matching is now by exact MIME
  type or well-defined suffix
- `gz` and `tgz` are now detected as archives (missing from the `mime`
  package's extension map)

### Changed
- MIME type matching ignores parameters (`text/html; charset=utf-8` now
  detects as html) and falls back to category-prefix classification for
  unlisted types (`image/x-custom` now detects as image)
- `fromExtensionOrMime()` tolerates a leading dot in `extension` (`.jpg`)
- `FileType.extensionMap`, `FileType.values`, and
  `ExtensionsGrouping.categorizedExtensions` are now unmodifiable (mutating
  them previously corrupted detection globally)
- Legacy StarOffice/OpenOffice.org MIME types now classify as document
- Minimum Dart SDK is now declared as `^3.2.0` (the previous `>=2.12.0`
  claim was never satisfiable given the `mime ^2.0.0` dependency)

### Deprecated
- `FileType.isAnyType()` — compares `runtimeType` only, which breaks for
  subclasses; use `is` checks or `isAny()` instead

### Development
- Enabled `dart_flutter_team_lints` in `analysis_options.yaml` (it was
  declared as a dev dependency but never included) and fixed all findings
- Added regression tests for all fixes (105 tests total)
